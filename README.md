- 👋 Hi, I’m @Davethepitt
- 📖 I'm currently reading Skyjack and Nobody's Girl
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (Wish me luck)
- 😕 Also trying to get my head around Git
- 🤷‍♂️ Oh yeah, and Markdown Language.
- 📫 You can reach me on Mastodon [@davethepitt@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@davethepitt) or Bluesky [@davethepitt.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/davethepitt.bsky.social)
- 🤯 Believe it or not I'm a Performance Poet and Playwright. That's where my real skill is. You can find out more on my socials or my website. [www.davethepitt.co.uk](https://www.davethepitt.co.uk). I also have a [Substack](https://davethepitt.substack.com/) where I talk about creativity and share some of the stuff I'm actually good at. 

This set of repos is going to get "messy". I'm learning Git, Github, Markdown and Python by doing little projects and sharing them on here. I don't share them to show off. Far from it. Maybe, just maybe, someone can help me find better ways of coding these things so I can learn. Also, maybe, just maybe, someone sees this and chooses to dive in themselves. 

So yes, this will be messy. You probably won't learn anything. But you might be inspired.
